# Hello there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="35px">

Hi, I'm Giacomo, I write software since always and doing this work professionaly for 10 years.<br/>
Currently Software Engineer at [Prima](https://www.helloprima.com/).<br/>

I started writing code when I was a kid. I have a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.<br/>
What drives me in this field is the ability to craft and transform ideas into digital products that people actually use.<br/>
That's where I got my obsession for user experience and design when writing software.

I'm a movie buff and I enjoy writing technical blog posts or short notes<br />
and I do this in [my blog](http://giacomocerquone.com/).<br />
